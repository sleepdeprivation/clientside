####Everything I thought was right was actually wrong
Guess what! You don't need an API key to use google maps apparently.

So here:

````bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
````

will return the manifest file to pushing and pulling like normal

Turns out none of it matters.
