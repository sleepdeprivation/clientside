Guess what! You really do need an API key to use google maps...

But I've sent everyone a new one! Please don't push it to the repo...

You might need this:

````bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
````

it will return the manifest file to pushing and pulling like normal
